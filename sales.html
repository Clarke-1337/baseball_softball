	<p>This is our sales page. We're going to list the items that we currently 
	use. But, you're most definitely not limited to just these options. When 
	buying equipment or apparel you want to in into consider your position 
	(glove), your size (pants), what brand of shoes is comfortable to you 
	(cleats), and your strength and height (bat). There are countless numbers of
	websites and stores you can go to to look at equipment or apparel to be
	prepared for a game, practice, or just having fun. Some popular places like
	Scheels, Dick's Sporting Goods, or even just the actual brand website like
	Rawlings or Marucci. Or, there is also fan gear you can buy for your favorite
	team whether it's a major league team or college.</p>
